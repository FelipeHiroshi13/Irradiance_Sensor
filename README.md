#  Irradiance Measurement System Shield Arduino

This project is based in Inexpensive Solar Irradiance Measurement System Design, with a PV Cell (Reference cell). Besides, the shield for Arduino will read the voltage and current of the embedded systems powered with a PV Cell.

## PV CELL

The reference cell used in this project is an ANYSOLAR product line of Solar Module made of monocrystalline, high efficiency solar cells.
